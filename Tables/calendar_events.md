# Business Rules

* Events **must have a valid `event_date` and `event_time`** for accurate scheduling.
* The `survey`, `actual`, `prior`, and `revision` fields can all be `NULL` if unavailable at the time of entry.
* `importance` is typically used to filter/highlight events on dashboards.
* `updated_at` allows tracking of when values are modified â€” useful for caching, alerts, and audit trails.
