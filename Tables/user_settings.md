# Business Rules

- A `user_settings` record **must exist for each user** â€” create it at registration or on first access.
- The `user_id` serves as both the primary key and foreign key.
- This table helps manage **account visibility, security preferences, and communication options**.

---

# Security Considerations

- If `two_factor_enabled = true`, ensure your system requires a second factor (e.g., TOTP, SMS) during login.
- You may choose to automatically set `last_password_change` on password reset/update.
