| Related Table   | Relationship Type | Foreign Key       | Description                            |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `users`         | Many-to-One       | `user_id`         | The user who receives the notification |
| `notifications` | Many-to-One       | `notification_id` | The notification being tracked         |

## Business Rules

* A notification will only appear to the user if `notification_enabled = true`.
* `is_read` and `is_dismissed` are independent flags â€” a user may dismiss without reading or vice versa.
* `delivered_at` can be used to measure notification delivery performance or delay.
