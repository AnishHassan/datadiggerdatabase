# Example Record

```json
{
  "id": "e1d3ffea-7a18-48b0-94be-5c8b1f3c037e",
  "user_id": "bb13b8df-2f87-4f76-973e-123b5f7412ee",
  "dataset_id": "6cce97e6-3fc1-4a87-b327-95fbd82c47d7",
  "saved_at": "2025-06-21T14:45:00Z"
}

# Usage Scenarios

* Showing a userâ€™s bookmarked datasets on their dashboard.
* Preventing duplicate saves using the `(user_id, dataset_id)` uniqueness constraint.
* Allowing users to manage or reorder saved datasets by `saved_at`.
* Supporting features like "Recently Saved" or "Favorites".

# Query Examples

# 1. Get all datasets saved by a specific user

```sql
SELECT dataset_id, saved_at
FROM dataset_saves
WHERE user_id = 'bb13b8df-2f87-4f76-973e-123b5f7412ee'
ORDER BY saved_at DESC;
```

# 2. Check if a dataset is already saved by a user

```sql
SELECT 1
FROM dataset_saves
WHERE user_id = 'bb13b8df-2f87-4f76-973e-123b5f7412ee'
  AND dataset_id = '6cce97e6-3fc1-4a87-b327-95fbd82c47d7';
```

# 3. Count how many users have saved a given dataset

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_saves
FROM dataset_saves
WHERE dataset_id = '6cce97e6-3fc1-4a87-b327-95fbd82c47d7';
```

# Insert Example

```sql
INSERT INTO dataset_saves (
  id,
  user_id,
  dataset_id,
  saved_at
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'bb13b8df-2f87-4f76-973e-123b5f7412ee',
  '6cce97e6-3fc1-4a87-b327-95fbd82c47d7',
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
