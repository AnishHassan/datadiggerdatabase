# Query Examples

# 1. Get All Upcoming High-Impact Events

```sql
SELECT *
FROM commodity_calendar_events
WHERE impact = 'High'
  AND date >= CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY date, time;
```

---

# 2. Compare Actual vs Survey for Crude Oil Events

```sql
SELECT title, date, survey_value, actual_value
FROM commodity_calendar_events
WHERE title ILIKE '%Crude Oil%'
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

---

# 3. Revised Events in the Last 30 Days

```sql
SELECT *
FROM commodity_calendar_events
WHERE revision_value IS NOT NULL
  AND date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

---

# 4. Aggregated Impact Counts by Type

```sql
SELECT data_type, impact, COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM commodity_calendar_events
GROUP BY data_type, impact
ORDER BY data_type, impact;
```

---

# 5. Time Series of Actual Inventory for a Region

```sql
SELECT date, actual_value
FROM commodity_calendar_events
WHERE data_type = 'Inventory'
  AND region = 'EIA'
  AND actual_value IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY date;
```

---

# Insert Example

```sql
INSERT INTO commodity_calendar_events (
  country_iso2, region, date, time, title, impact,
  survey_value, actual_value, prior_value, revision_value,
  unit, source_url, data_provider, data_type
) VALUES (
  'US', 'EIA', '2025-06-19', '14:30:00', 'Crude Oil Inventories', 'High',
  '-1.2M', '-2.3M', '3.0M', '2.8M',
  'barrels', 'https://www.eia.gov/petroleum', 'EIA', 'Inventory'
